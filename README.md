# Distributed ID Allocator

This document explains the distributed ID allocation scheme which generates small number representations of arbitrary non-colliding Version 4 UUIDs (stable IDs) across multiple sessions in a network.

## Overview

The distributed ID allocation scheme allows clients to use small numbers that map to UUIDs while retaining many properties of UUIDs. The primary benefit is increased efficiency and reduced storage size. The scheme also improves runtime performance when used as keys in collections or other data structures.

The allocator is designed to work within a service that provides total order broadcast, relying on a centralized service to determine a total order for the allocations.

## Sessions

A session can be thought of as a unique identifier for a single allocator. Even if an allocator is taken offline, serialized to disk, and rehydrated back, it's considered the same session if it has the same session ID.

## Generation API

New IDs are generated by calling a generation API on an allocator. The API returns a small number representation of the UUID with the following guarantees:

- The ID can be converted into a full UUID at any time.
- Prior to the service being notified of the ID's creation, it is unique within the scope of the session (e.g. it can collide with IDs allocated by a different allocator in the same network).
- After the service has been notified of the ID's creation and has determined a total ordering between all clients creating IDs, the ID will have a _final_ form that is a small number representation that is unique across all sessions.

The first form is called a _session space ID_ (unique within the session scope), and the latter is called a _final ID_.

## ID Spaces

There are two ID spaces:

1. Session space: IDs are unique within the session scope.
2. Op space: IDs are normalized to their most final form, as unique as possible within the entire system.

## Normalization

The process of moving between session space and op space is called normalization.

## Efficiency Properties

### UUID Generation

The allocator generates UUIDs in non-random ways to reduce entropy, optimizing storage of data. Sequentially allocated UUIDs, starting at a random UUID, are less likely to collide than fully random generated UUIDs and this fact can be leveraged to compact the on-disk and in-memory representations of the allocator.

### Clustering

The sequential allocation trick allows the system to build a clustering scheme where IDs are clustered.

As allocators across the network create IDs, they reserve a large block of positive ID space (a cluster) for that allocator. The positive integer space is sharded across different clients and session space IDs are mapped into these clusters.

Clusters are efficient to store, requiring only two integers: the base positive integer in the cluster and the count of reserved IDs in that cluster.

### Normalization Process

The normalization process involves a simple binary search on the cluster table stored by all allocators.

## Usage Guidelines

- Expose only session space IDs to application authors. This means that application developers don't need to manage multiple ID spaces or worry about converting IDs between session space and op space. This simplifies the data management process and reduces the chances of errors or inconsistencies.
- Use op space IDs for serialized forms, such as sending information over the wire or storing it in a file. This is because op space IDs are unique within the entire system, whereas session space IDs are unique only within a specific session. When persisting data, it's crucial to ensure that IDs remain unique across different sessions, clients, or machines to avoid collisions or conflicts.

## Implementation Details

### ID Generation API

The generation API returns either a negative integer (representing an offset from the session ID) or an eager final ID (if a cluster was previously allocated and has room for more IDs).

### Op Space

IDs in op space are as final as possible. Not all IDs in op space are positive integers; some might be session space IDs (negative integers).

### Serialization

When serializing op space IDs, annotate the entire context (e.g., file or network operation) with the session ID, so recipients can interpret session space negative IDs and convert them to corresponding final IDs.
